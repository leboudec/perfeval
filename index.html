  <!-- <h3>GOALS</h3> -->

  <p>Performance Evaluation is often the critical part in
  evaluating the results of a research project. Many of us are
  familiar with simulations, but it is often difficult to address
  questions like</p>

  <ul>
<li>I want to estimate a probability of error and I see
no error in <i>n</i> experiments: what can I say about the error probability ?</li>

<li>I would like to characterize the
fairness of my protocol. Should I use Jain's Fairness Index or
the Lorenz Curve Gap ?</li>

    <li>should I eliminate the beginning of the simulation in order
    to wait until the system stabilizes ?</li>

    <li> I would like to fit an explanatory model to my data, I was told to use least squares for that; is that the right thing to do ? Why ?</li>

    <li>I simulate a random way point model but the average speed
    in my simulation is not as expected. What happened ?</li>

    <li>the reviewers of my paper complained that I did not provide
    confidence intervals. What is that ? How do I get them ?</li>
    <li>how do I analyze the power consumption of my system ?</li>
 <li> I would like to fit a distribution to
the flow sizes that I measured but all my measurements are
truncated to a maximum value; how do I account for the
truncation ?</li>
<li>what is Palm calculus and why should I know about it ?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These and other questions are the topic of this book, which began as a set of lecture notes taught at EPFL. </p>
